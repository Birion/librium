# Librium Project Requirements

## Overview
Librium is a book management system designed to help users track their personal book collections. The application allows users to store detailed metadata about books, including authors, publishers, genres, languages, and series information.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Book Management**
   - Add new books to the collection
   - Edit existing book information
   - View detailed book information
   - Track read/unread status of books

2. **Metadata Management**
   - Associate books with authors (multiple authors per book)
   - Categorise books by genre
   - Organise books into series
   - Track book formats (paperback, hardcover, etc.)
   - Record book languages
   - Associate books with publishers

3. **Collection Organisation**
   - Group books by series
   - Filter books by various metadata (author, genre, etc.)
   - Track reading progress across the collection

## Technical Requirements

### Platform & Environment
1. **Python Version**: Python 3.11
2. **Dependency Management**: Pipenv for managing project dependencies
3. **Database**: SQLite for data storage
4. **Web Framework**: Flask for the web application

### Architecture
1. **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database operations
2. **Asset Pipeline**: Flask-Assets for managing static assets
   - SASS for CSS preprocessing
   - CoffeeScript for JavaScript preprocessing
3. **API**: RESTful API for interacting with the application

### Development Standards
1. **Code Style**: PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests using Python's unittest framework
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation for development and usage

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **Database**: Must use SQLite for data storage
2. **ORM**: Must use SQLAlchemy for database operations
3. **Web Framework**: Must use Flask for the web application
4. **Python Version**: Must be compatible with Python 3.11

### Performance Constraints
1. **Response Time**: Application should respond to user actions within a reasonable time frame
2. **Scalability**: Should handle personal book collections of reasonable size (up to thousands of books)

## Future Considerations
1. **Mobile Support**: Potential for mobile-friendly interface
2. **Data Import/Export**: Ability to import/export book data from/to other formats
3. **Integration**: Potential integration with external book databases for metadata retrieval
4. **Advanced Search**: Enhanced search capabilities for finding books in large collections
